bancho.py is an in-progress osu! server implementation for developers of all levels
of experience interested in hosting their own osu private server instance(s).

the project is developed primarily by the [osu!Akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw/) team,
and our aim is to create the most easily maintainable, reliable, and feature-rich
osu! server implementation available.

# Setup
knowledge of linux, python, and databases will certainly help, but are by no
means required.

(lots of people have installed this server with no prior programming experience!)

if you get stuck at any point in the process - we have a public discord above :)

this guide will be targetted towards ubuntu - other distros may have slightly
different setup processes.

## download the osu! server codebase onto your machine
```sh
# clone bancho.py's repository
git clone https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/bancho.py

# enter bancho.py's new directory
cd bancho.py

# clone bancho.py's dependencies' repositories
git submodule update --init
```

## installing bancho.py's requirements
bancho.py is a ~15,000 line codebase built on the shoulder of giants.

we aim to minimize our dependencies, but still rely on ones such as
- python (programming language)
- mysql (relational database)
- nginx (http(s) reverse proxy)
- certbot (ssl certificate tool)
- cmake and build-essential (build tools for c/c++)

as well as some others.
```sh
# python3.9 is often not available natively,
# but we can rely on deadsnakes to provide it.
# https://github.com/deadsnakes/python3.9
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes

# install required programs for running bancho.py
sudo apt install python3.9-dev python3.9-distutils \
                 cmake build-essential \
                 mysql-server redis-server \
                 nginx certbot

# install python's package manager, pip
# it's used to install python-specific dependencies
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py

# make sure pip and setuptools are up to date
python3.9 -m pip install -U pip setuptools

# install bancho.py's python-specific dependencies
python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## creating a database for bancho.py
you will need to create a database for bancho.py to store persistent data.

the server uses this database to store metadata & logs, such as user accounts
and stats, beatmaps and beatmapsets, chat channels, tourney mappools and more.

```sh
# login to mysql's shell with root - the default admin account

# note that this shell can be rather dangerous - it allows users
# to perform arbitrary sql commands to interact with the database.

# it's also very useful, powerful, and quick when used correctly.
mysql -u root -p
```

from this mysql shell, we'll want to create a database, create a user account,
and give the user full permissions to the database.

then, later on, we'll configure bancho.py to use this database as well.
```sql
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_DB_NAME
# - YOUR_DB_USER
# - YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

# create a database for bancho.py to use
CREATE DATABASE YOUR_DB_NAME;

# create a user to use the bancho.py database
CREATE USER 'YOUR_DB_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_DB_PASSWORD';

# grant the user full access to all tables in the bancho.py database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON YOUR_DB_NAME.* TO 'YOUR_DB_USER'@'localhost';

# make sure privilege changes are applied immediately.
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# exit the mysql shell, back to bash
quit
```

## setting up the database's structure for bancho.py
we've now created an empty database - databases are full of 2-dimensional
tables of data.

bancho.py has many tables it uses to organize information, for example, there
are tables like `users` and `scores` for storing their respective information.

the columns (vertical) represent the types of data stored for a `user` or `score`.
for example, the number of 300s in a score, or the privileges of a user.

the rows (horizontal) represent the individual items or events in a table.
for example, an individual score in the scores table.

this base state of the database is stored in `ext/base.sql`; it's a bunch of
sql commands that can be run in sequence to create the base state we want.
```sh
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_DB_NAME
# - YOUR_DB_USER

# import bancho.py's mysql structure to our new db
# this runs the contents of the file as sql commands.
mysql -u YOUR_DB_USER -p YOUR_DB_NAME < migrations/base.sql
```

## creating an ssl certificate (to allow https traffic)
```sh
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
# - YOUR_DOMAIN

# generate an ssl certificate for your domain
sudo certbot certonly \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges=dns \
    --email YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
    --agree-tos \
    -d *.YOUR_DOMAIN
```

## configuring a reverse proxy (we'll use nginx)
bancho.py relies on a reverse proxy for tls (https) support, and for ease-of-use
in terms of configuration. nginx is an open-source and efficient web server we'll
be using for this guide, but feel free to check out others, like caddy and h2o.

```sh
# copy the example nginx config to /etc/nginx/sites-available,
# and make a symbolic link to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo cp ext/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bancho.conf

# now, you can edit the config file.
# the spots you'll need to change are marked.
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf

# reload config from disk
sudo nginx -s reload
```

## configuring bancho.py
all configuration for the osu! server (bancho.py) itself can be done from the
`.env` file. we provide an example `.env.example` file which you can use as a base.
```sh
# create a configuration file from the sample provided
cp .env.example .env

# you'll want to configure *at least* DB_DSN (the database connection url),
# as well as set the OSU_API_KEY if you need any info from osu!'s v1 api
# (e.g. beatmaps).

# open the configuration file for editing
nano .env
```

## congratulations! you just setup an osu! private server

if everything went well, you should be able to start your server up:

```sh
# start the server
./main.py
```

and you should see something along the lines of:
